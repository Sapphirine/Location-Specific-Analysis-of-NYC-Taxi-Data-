This repository contains a general overview of the queires ran against
the NYC Taxi dataset from 2012 and 2013.

The file BigDataTaxiQueries is not an executable and is instead meant as a supplement to
our report and an introduction to running your own queries while introducing the logic used in investigating the 
datasets.
